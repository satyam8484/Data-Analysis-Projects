## Sales Data Anlysis
Here we are Solving Solving real world data science tasks with Python Pandas!

we are performing data analysis on sales data 
we hava data for each month 1st we will combine it into one CSV using pandas (All_month_Data.csv) then perform Data Analysis on it


you can do Same task using Excel but it'll take time for processing as it is very large Data. still i have given answer of some questions using Excel 
Check out that also ( Good exercise to learn Excel )




Task #1: Merging 12 csvs into a single dataframe 
 Read single CSV file
 List all files in a directory 
 Concatenating files
 Reading in Updated dataframe

Task #2: Add a Month column 
 Parse string in Pandas cell (.str)

Cleaning our data!
 Drop NaN values from df
 Remove rows based on condition

Task #3: Add a sales column 
 Another way to convert a column to numeric (ints & floats)

Question #1: What was the best month for sales? 
 Visualizing our results with bar chart in matplotlib

Question #2: What city sold the most product? 
 Add a city column
 Using the .apply() method (super useful!!)
 Why do we use the lambda x ?
 Dropping a column
 Answering the question (using groupby)
 Plotting our results

Question #3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases? 
 Using to_datetime() method
 Creating hour & minute columns
 Matplotlib line graph to plot our results
 Interpreting our results

Question #4: What products are most often sold together? 
 Finding duplicate values in our DataFrame
 Use transform() method to join values from two rows into a single row
 Dropping rows with duplicate values
 Counting pairs of products (itertools, collections)

Question #5: What product sold the most? Why do you think it did? 
 Graphing data
 Overlaying a second Y
 Interpreting our results
